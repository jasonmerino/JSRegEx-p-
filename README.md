# JSRegEx(p)

JSRegEx(p) is a tool for learning and testing out JavaScript Regular Expressions. Select a set of data and type your regular expression into the two fields provided. As you type various elements in the data set will get greyed out if they do not match the pattern you have created and elements that retain their dark color will be the remaining set of elements that do match the pattern.

## Project Scope/Further Improvements

This project grew out of a need for testing regular expressions with very litte working knowledge of how regular expressions work. I'm sure there are many features that can be added to these few files to better help a user learn/check what they need. A few possible improvements are things like custom data sets, easily viewable documentation, better error notifications, etc (I'm sure the list could go on and on). To be blunt and completely honest, those may or may not happen in the future.

## Setup

To setup the project locally, clone the repo.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jasonmerino/JSRegEx-p-.git
```

Then `cd` into the JSRegEx-p- folder and install the packages and resources.

```bash
cd JSRegEx-p- && npm install && bower install
```

Once that has finished run the Express server and follow the URL!

```bash
node app.js
```
